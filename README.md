# Analytical Calculation of Supersonic Diffuser and Nozzle

This study aims to validate the optimal geometries derived from the analytical calculations of the diffuser and nozzle. Part I focuses on the diffuser, while Part II will assess the nozzles based on their inviscid and viscous behavior.

All simulations presented in this document were conducted using the tools provided by ANSYS, specifically the CFD application FLUENT.
